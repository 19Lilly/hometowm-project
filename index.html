            Bratislava is the only one European capital city, which borders with
            two other countries - Hungary and Austria.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bratislava and Vienna are the closest two capitals in Europe - only
            60km far away from each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            Petrzalka - the largest borough of Bratislava - is the most densely
            populated residential district in Central Europe.
          </li>
          <li>
            A cycling bridge connecting Austria and Bratislava should have been
            named after Chuck Norris, but officials rejected this name and named
            it a "Bridge of Freedom"
          </li>
          <li>
            Slavin memorial above Bratislava is actually an official cemetery
            for 6,845 Soviets soldiers, who died in 1945 during the liberation
            of Bratislava
          </li>

            Bratislava is probably the only city in the world, where you can
            have a lunch in a UFO

                Bratislava Castle, the landmark overlooking the Capital, was
                built in the 9th century. As an agelong symbol of the city, it
                proudly stands on the hill above Danube river. Eleven kings and
                eight queens were crowned in Bratislava in the past. No wonder
                that the castle is a popular part of excursions through the
                city.

                Come to have a look at the 7th largest hanging bridge in the
                world. Get a panoramic view on the whole Bratislava from the
                open-air observation deck on top of its UFO-shaped cupola.
                Refresh yourself in a fine dining restaurant or a bar which are
                up there, too. But mainly – get your camera ready! Photos taken
                here will surely be a great memory!

                Churches, town walls and palaces pay tribute to the centuries of
                history. Thematic and humorous bronze statues, and a laser light
                show on summer evenings, are more modern additions. When you’re
                tired and ready to relax, you can move to the Danube and just
                watch the great river flow.
